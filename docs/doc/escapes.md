# Escape codes supported by *that terminal*

## Non-esc codes:

Note: Tables include also a few items marked “unsupported”.
These are documented for possible future use,
and are not supported by this terminal emulator.
They are also parsed correctly, even if they do not do anything.

All of these are recognized even in the middle of an escape code.
E.g. `printf("ABC\033[3\n4mDEF");` will print “ABC” on the current line with the current attribute and “DEF” on the next line with blue color (SGR 34).

* `<07>`  Beep
* `<08>`  Backspace: Moves cursor left by one column, no erase. Does nothing if cursor is already in the leftmost column.
* `<09>`  Tab: Moves cursor right to the next tab column.
* `<0D>`  Carriage return: Moves cursor to the leftmost column.
* `<0E>`  Selects G1 character set for GL
* `<0F>`  Selects G0 character set for GL
* `<7F>`  Del (ignored)
* `<18>`, `<1A>`, `<80>`, `<81>`, `<82>`, `<83>`, `<86>`, `<87>`, `<89>`,
`<8A>`, `<8B>`, `<8C>`, `<91>`, `<92>`, `<93>`, `<94>`, `<95>`, `<99>`
Ignored, terminates and cancels any ESC code (including an OSC/DCS string)
* `<0A>`, `<0B>`, `<0C>` ⁴Line feed: Moves cursor down within window; if at bottom
of the window, scrolls window up and inserts a blank line at bottom.
If the cursor is at the bottom of the screen
but the window bottom is somewhere above,
no scrolling or cursor movement happens.

Any other character is printed, unless an escape code is being parsed.
The cursor is moved to the next column after printing.
If the last character was printed to the last column of the screen,
the next character is printed to the first column of the next row
as if a linefeed was performed in the between. An automatic linefeed
does not happen until the new character is printed.

## Esc codes:

* `<1B>`      ESC.
* `<ESC> [`   CSI (Control Sequence Introducer). An optional number of non-negative integer parameters may follow, separated by either `:` or `;`.
* `<CSI> "`   CSI".
* `<CSI> ?`   CSI?.
* `<ESC> c`   Resets console. Acts as if these commands were performed consecutively:
  * `<ESC> ( B` `<ESC> ) B` `<ESC> * B` `<ESC> + B` `<0F>` Resets G0,G1,G2,G3 to default and selects G0
  * `<CSI> * x` Resets the character attribute change extent
  * `<CSI> m` Sets attributes to default
  * `<CSI> r` Sets window to default (entire screen)
  * `<CSI> H` Puts cursor at top-left corner
  * `<CSI> 2 J` Clears screen
  * `<CSI?> 5 l` Clears screen-inverse flag
  * `<CSI?> 25 h` Shows cursor
* `<ESC> 7` , `<CSI> s` Saves current console state (cursor position, character attributes)
* `<ESC> 8` , `<CSI> u` Restores console state (cursor position, character attributes)
* `<ESC> M`   ⁴Reverse linefeed: Moves cursor up within window; if at top of
the window, scrolls window down and inserts a blank line at top.
If the cursor is at the topmost line of the screen,
but the top edge of the window is somewhere below,
no scrolling or cursor movement happens.
* `<ESC> E`   Acts like `<0D>` followed by `<0A>`.
* `<ESC> D`   Acts like `<0A>`. Can be used to produce LF behavior
without CR even when the TTY is automatically translating linefeeds into LF+CR.
* `<ESC> V`, `<CSI"> q` (If param is 1) Start protected writes
* `<ESC> W`, `<CSI"> q` (If param is 2, 0, or missing) End protected writes. Any characters written in “protected” mode
will be immune of erase operations. They can still be overwritten by
printing anything (including spaces) over them.

* `<CSI> g`    TBC: Set tab stops (unsupported)
* `<CSI> q`    Set LED states (unsupported)
* `<CSI> $ r`  Change character attributes in rectangular area.
First 4 params define the rectangle (top line,left column,bottom line,right column), the rest are the SGR sequence. Xterm only supports attributes 0/1/4/5/7/8 and 22/24/25/27/28, but *That terminal* supports all the same attributes that `<CSI> m` does.
* `<CSI> $ t`  Toggle character attributes in rectangular area
* `<CSI> $ v`  Copy rectangular area. Takes eight parameters:
First 4 params define the rectangle, next is page number,
next two are the target coordinates, and the final is the target page number.
Xterm ignores the page numbers.
This code (DECCRA), together with `<CSI> X`, can be used very efficiently to implement vertical windows that can scroll independently.
* `<CSI> $ z`  Fill rectangular area with space. First 4 params define the rectangle. Attributes are not touched.
* `<CSI> $ {`  Fill rectangular area with space *selectively* (unsupported). Same as `<CSI> $ z` except leaves protected characters untouched.
* `<CSI> $ x`  Fill rectangular area with given character and current attribute. First parameter is the character number code, next four define the rectangle.
* `<CSI> $ |`  Set screen width to the given value (only widths 80 or 132 allowed; default=80) (unsupported)
* `<CSI> * |`  Set screen height to the given value (valid range between 1 and 255, inclusive) (unsupported)
* `<CSI> * x`  Set character attribute change extent (unsupported). Value 2 means that attribute-changing rectangular operations will perform rectangularly. Any other value (mainly 0 or 1) means that attribute-changing rectangular operations will perform on a text stream delimited by the first and last character position indicated. This flag will not affect the other rectangular operations, such as fills.
* `<CSI> * y`  Request checksum of rectangular area (unsupported)
* `<ESC> # 3`   Change current line to be rendered using top half of double-height & double-width letters. See comment in `<ESC> # 6`.
* `<ESC> # 4`   Change current line to be rendered using bottom half of double-height & double-width letters. See comment in `<ESC> # 6`.
* `<ESC> # 5`   Change current line to be rendered using single-height & single-width (regular) letters. This is the default.
* `<ESC> # 6`   Change current line to be rendered using single-height & double-width letters. This halves the
rendered row length, but logically the row is still same length as every
other row. The second half of the line is simply not displayed at all.
* `<ESC> # 8`   ²Clears screen with the letter “E” using the current attribute. This is
intended for testing the double-width / double-height character modes. Cursor is moved to the top-left corner of the screen.
* `<ESC> % @`   Unsets UTF8 mode. (unsupported)
* `<ESC> % G`, `<ESC> % 8`   Sets UTF8 mode. (unsupported)
* `<ESC> ( <char>`    Set G0 to character set <char>.

* `<ESC> / <char>`    Set G3 to type 2 character set <char>.
* `<ESC> <7C>` Select G3 character set for GR (unsupported)
* `<ESC> <7D>` Select G2 character set for GR (unsupported)
* `<ESC> <7E>` Select G1 character set for GR (unsupported)
* `<ESC> N <char>`, `<8E> <char>`  Temporarily selects G2, and prints `<char>` (unsupported)
* `<ESC> O <char>`, `<8F> <char>`  Temporarily selects G3, and prints `<char>` (unsupported)
* `<9C>`, `<ESC> <5C>`, `<07>` ST.
* `<ESC> ^ <string> <ST>`, `<9E> <string> <ST>` PM, Privacy Message (unsupported) (ignored by Xterm; Screen uses this to display messages in status line. Screen also supports `ESC ! <string> <ST>` as an alias.)
* `<ESC> _ <string> <ST>`, `<9F> <string> <ST>` APC, Application Program Command (unsupported) (ignored by Xterm; Screen uses this for changing the window title)
* `<ESC> X <string> <ST>`, `<98> <string> <ST>` SOS, Start of String (unsupported) (ignored by Xterm)
* `<ESC> P <string> <ST>`, `<90> <string> <ST>` DCS, Device Control String
  * Depending on the value of `<string>`:
    * `$ q r` Responds with `<ESC> P 1 $ r <top> ; <bottom> q <ST>` where `<top>` and `<bottom>` are the scrolling region boundaries
    * `$ q m` Responds with `<ESC> P 1 $ r <sgr> q <ST>` where `<sgr>` expresses the SGR sequence representing the current foreground and background colors

    * `$ q <20> q` Responds with `<ESC> P 1 $ <c> <20> q <ST>` where `<c>` is 1 for a blocky cursor, 3 for an underline cursor, and 5 for a bar cursor, +1 if the cursor is not blinking
    * `$ q " q` Responds with `<ESC> P 1 $ r <p> " q <ST>` where `<p>` indicates whether protected mode is active (see `<ESC> V`)
    * `$ q " p` Responds with `<ESC> P 1 $ r <l> ; <p> " q <ST>` where `<l>` is vtXX_level + 60, `<p>` indicates whether 8-bit controls are *disabled* (see `<CSI"> p`)
    * `$ q $ |` Responds with `<ESC> P 1 $ r <n> $ | <ST>` where `<n>` is the screen width in columns (either 80 or 132). Not the actual width, but the state of the `<CSI?> h` mode 3.
    * `$ q * |` Responds with `<ESC> P 1 $ r <n> * | <ST>` where `<n>` is the screen height in rows

Blank = space character with current attributes.  
¹ = Missing or zero parameter is interpreted as 1.  
² = Ignores window boundaries.  
³ = Any number of parameters can be specified; all of them will be processed.  
⁴ = Does not allow the cursor to escape the window; however, if the cursor
  is already outside the window, allows moving to another row
  even if the target row is even farther outside the window.

No cursor movement command allows the cursor to leave the *screen*.
However, as an exception, after printing,
the cursor is allowed to temporarily sit
on the rightmost edge of the screen,
outside the visible area.
Printing anything there will invoke an automatic linefeed.
For the purposes of cursor movement commands,
the cursor is still inside the visible area.

None of the commands move the cursor unless explicitly specified.
This is important to note especially with the scrolling,
clearing/erasing, and writing commands.

When any invalid escape code is encountered,
the escape code until the invalid character is silently ignored,
and the next character is processed as if no escape code was actived.

None of these escape codes are custom-made for this terminal emulator.
All of these are supported by e.g. Xterm (although Xterm does not render italic).
